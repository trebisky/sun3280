Sun 3/280 project

May 19, 2025

I dusted off the Sun 3/280 I have here and powered it up.
Now I am going to try writing some bare metal code to run on it.

Here are the projects

1. blink - the usual starting place
1. serial - hello world would be next
1. puller - python script to download mmu setup
1. libgcc - steal some things from libgcc
1. printf - printf and improved C startup
