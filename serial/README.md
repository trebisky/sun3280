Sun 3/280 projects - a serial demo

May 20, 2025

We can sort of blink the lights, now let's see if
 we can write to a serial port

A tip to sun3 hackers.  I have been using picocom to give
me a break to get back to the rom.  Then I was using k2
to do a full reset and test new code.  Just typing "b"
is faster and perfect in most caes.

Typing b! is super fast (it does not do a reset).
